Sometimes the amount of mine generated is not correct. firstly because of way the mines are generated:
An array is ran throug a for loop as many times as the user chooses. a random number(from 1 to the sum of the lenght and height of the board)
is generated and stored into the array, however often the same number number is generated and there for the mines value to a cell is assigned
two times or more, thus the less mines appear on the board. 
edit: also the whole game is writen in one function so it bugs out a lot
